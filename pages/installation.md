## Prerequisites
* A C++ compiler that supports C++17, e.g. `g++` or `clang`, and `Make`
* An implementation of the Blas/Lapack routines, e.g. the Netlib Blas/Lapack, IntelMKL or Accelerate on OSX.
* `git` version control system
* (optional) An implementation of the MPI standard, e.g. OpenMPI

## Compiling the library

**Step 1:**
Choose an installation directory

```bash
cd /path/to/hydra
```

**Step 2:**
Clone the hydra library from github

```bash
git clone https://github.com/awietek/hydra.git
```

**Step 3:**
Create a copy of "options.mk"

```bash
cd hydra
cp options.mk.sample options.mk
```

**Step 4:**
Modify your copy of "options.mk" for your system using your favorite text editor. The instructions for doing so are in the file "options.mk". 

```bash
emacs options.mk
```

**Step 5:**
Compile the library

```bash
make
```

You can also use multithreading to compile faster, i.e.

```bash
make -j
```

If you want to use the MPI features of Hydra, you will also need to compile
the MPI-library

```bash
make mpi
```

That's it, you're all set!

## Running tests

In order to make sure, everything is workign properly, you could run full test suite on your system.

**Step 1:** Compile the tests

```bash
make test
```
This will create an executable "test/tests". If you would also like to test the MPI features, compile the MPI tests

```bash
make testmpi
```
This creates the executable "testmpi/tests"

**Step 2:** Run the tests
```bash
cd test
./tests
```
You can run the MPI tests (e.g. using 4 cores) using
```bash
cd testmpi
mpirun -np 4 tests
```

## Compiling applications

When using Hydra, you will need to write a separate application. This application then needs to be linked to the hydra and lapack libraries and the lila and hydra headers need to be included. We have several examples of applications in the folder `examples` in the root directory of hydra. To compile these applications, you could use a Makefile. In the folder `examples/spinhalf_chain` you find the application code `spinhalf_chain.cpp`, which can be compiled using the `Makefile` in the same folder. Let's have a look at it:

```bash
# Define the compiler and the compile options
cc       = g++
copt     = -O2 -std=c++17

# Set the directory of lila and hydra here
hydradir = /Users/awietek/Research/Software/hydra

# On Linux, you can use the lapack and blas libraries
lapacklib   = -llapack -lblas

# # On MacOs, you can use the Accelerate framework
# lapacklib   = -framework Accelerate

all:
	$(cc) $(copt) -I$(hydradir) -L$(hydradir)/lib  $(lapacklib) -lhydra main.cpp -o main
```

In the first two lines we set the compiler and some options for it. Next we define the directories where the hydra library is found. Then we set Blas/Lapack Backend.

```bash
make
```

and run the application with

```bash
./main
```

Et voil√†, you just ran your first ED using hydra!
